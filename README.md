# rl_playground

Welcome to **RL Playground**! This repository is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of **Reinforcement Learning** through small, experimental projects.

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here:
- Classic RL problems like CartPole and MountainCar from OpenAI Gym.
- Experiments with policy gradients and Q-learning.
- Applications of RL principles to language models and beyond.

## 🚀 Goals:
- Understand the fundamentals of reinforcement learning.
- Build agents that learn to make decisions through trial and error.
- Explore real-world applications of RL techniques.

## 📂 Project Structure:
- `q_learning/`: Train an agent via Q learning.

## 🤝 Contributions:
Feel free to fork, experiment, and submit pull requests to improve or expand the projects!
